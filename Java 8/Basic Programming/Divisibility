 which is not divisible by 
.



Solution


import java.util.*;

class TestClass {
    public static void main(String args[] ) throws Exception {

        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int N = 0;
        N = sc.nextInt();
        
        int[] data = new int[N];
        for(int i=0; i<N; i++){
            data[i] = sc.nextInt();
        }
         int number=0;
        for(int i=0;i<data.length;i++){
          number=number*10+(data[i]%10);
        }

        if(number/5==0)
        System.out.println("Yes");
        else
        System.out.println("No");
       
        
      
        
    }
}
