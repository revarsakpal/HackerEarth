Problem
You are given an array 
 consisting of 
 non-negative integers. Find out the minimum number 
 such that there exists a non-empty subset of 
 for which the bitwise OR of all its elements is equal to 
.

Input format

The first line contains an integer 
 (
) denoting the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains an integer 
 denoting the number of elements in array 
.
The second line of each test case contains 
 space-separated integers of array 
.
Note: It is guaranteed that sum of 
 over all test cases is less than or equal to 
.

Output format

For each test case, print a line containing the minimum possible value of 
.

Constraints




Sum of 
 over all test cases is less than or equal to 

Solution




import java.util.*;
class TestClass {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
		int n=sc.nextInt();
		
		while(n>0) {
		
			int k=sc.nextInt();
			int arr[]=new int[k];
			for(int i=0;i<arr.length;i++) {
				arr[i]=sc.nextInt();
			}
			Arrays.sort(arr);
			System.out.println(arr[0]);
			n--;
		}
		
	}
}
